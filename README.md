# Sprite Painter

    Actually, it's not just sprites it paints.

Image editor right within Godot 4!

Just press the colorful button above the viewport to edit a Node's texture, or an image file in the project folder!

- **Box and Wand selections**, which mask effects of drawing tools. The underlying pixels can be dragged and dropped elsewhere;
- 1-pixel **pencil** - can erase if secondary color is transparent;
- Round **brush** with **eraser** and smooth option;
- A classic **bucket** tool with a **gradient** variant;
- **Line** drawing;
- A number of **shapes** to shape your graphics;
- And a bit of **scripting** support.

Other features:
- Quick operations on the image: flip, rotate, and resize;
- Press Alt to pick color from editor window;
- Grid overlay for Sprites with Frames and Maps with Tiles;
- Region overlays for Atlastextures and Spriteframes;
- Full Undo support.
